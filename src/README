This is a red black tree program that can modify and search the tree
concurrently using readers/writers. Readers have priority over writers, and
readers cant read if there are any active writers.

To build the application, navigate to this directory and run "make".

To run it, run: ./redblack input.txt

If no input file is entered, the program will try to use RBTinput-1-1-1.txt
